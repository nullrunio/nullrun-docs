# Policies

A **policy** is a rule attached to your organization or a single
workflow. Every gate / execute call is evaluated against the merged
set of active policies for the key's workflow — the policy
engine returns `allow`, `block`, or `approval_required` from that
evaluation.

## Types

Three policy types exist. Each has a JSON `config` payload whose
shape is type-specific:

| Type | What it caps | `config` keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RateLimit` | Calls per minute (per workflow + per org aggregate) | `max_calls_per_minute` (i64) |
| `BudgetLimit` | Cumulative cost in cents (per workflow) | `budget_cents` (i64) |
| `ToolBlock` | Glob match on tool names — blocks / requires approval | `tool_pattern`, `blocked_tools`, or `tools` (array of strings ≤ 4096 bytes) |

`RateLimit` and `BudgetLimit` are core controls available on every
plan. `ToolBlock` requires the `CustomPolicies` entitlement (Growth
and above).

### Per-policy fields outside `config`

Three fields look like policy fields but are consumed by the
**detector layer**, not by the gate engine:

| Field | Default | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loop_threshold` | `6` | Loop detector — see [Loop detection](loop-detection.md). |
| `loop_window_secs` | `60` | Loop detector sliding window. |
| `anomaly_mode` | `Moderate` | Anomaly detector σ multiplier — see [Anomaly detection](anomaly-detection.md). |

## Scopes

Every policy has a `scope` of either `Org` or `Workflow`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    O["Org-scope policy<br/>applies to every workflow in the org"]
    W["Workflow-scope policy<br/>applies to one workflow_id"]
    X["Other org workflows"]

    O --> M["Effective policy set<br/>for workflow X"]
    W --> M
    X -. "not affected by W" .-> W
```

Org-scope policies are **inherited** by every workflow in the
organization — they apply everywhere by default. Workflow-scope
policies apply only to the bound workflow.

Both scopes are merged at evaluation time. There is no notion of
one scope "overriding" another — both apply simultaneously.

## Conflict resolution

When two policies in the merged set compete, the engine uses
**most-restrictive-wins** for numeric caps and **union** for tool
block patterns.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Merged["Effective policy set for workflow X"]
      A["Org RateLimit<br/>max_calls_per_minute = 60"]
      B["Workflow RateLimit<br/>max_calls_per_minute = 30"]
    end
    Merged --> E["Effective cap"]
    A --> E
    B --> E
    E --> Res["min(60, 30) = 30 cpm"]
```

| Field | Aggregation across active policies |
| --- | --- |
| `budget_cents` | `min()` |
| `max_calls_per_minute` | `min()` |
| `loop_threshold` | `min()` |
| `loop_window_secs` | `min()` |
| `anomaly_mode` | Stored per policy; not aggregated |
| `blocked_tools` / `tool_pattern` / `tools` | Union, deduplicated |

`policy_type` is **immutable** per row — updating a `RateLimit`
into a `BudgetLimit` returns `400 policy_type_immutable`. Delete
and recreate instead.

### Concrete example

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Org[Org-level policies]
      O1["BudgetLimit<br/>budget_cents = 5000"]
      O2["RateLimit<br/>max_calls_per_minute = 60"]
      O3["ToolBlock<br/>send_*, db.drop"]
    end
    subgraph Wf[Workflow-level policies]
      W1["BudgetLimit<br/>budget_cents = 2000"]
      W2["ToolBlock<br/>send_email"]
    end

    O1 --> M["Effective set"]
    O2 --> M
    O3 --> M
    W1 --> M
    W2 --> M

    M --> R["budget_cents: min(5000, 2000) = 2000<br/>max_calls_per_minute: 60<br/>blocked_tools: send_*, db.drop, send_email (dedup)"]
```

## Plan gating

| Resource | Gate |
| --- | --- |
| Total policy count per org | `plan_limits.policies_limit` (returns `429 plan_limit_exceeded`) |
| Sum of `max_calls_per_minute` across org | `plan_features.aggregate_rate_limit_per_min` (enforced on policy create) |
| `ToolBlock` policies | `Feature::CustomPolicies` (Growth+) |
| `human_approvals_enabled = true` on a workflow | `Feature::Approvals` (Growth+) |

## What's inherited, what's not

| Property | Inherited by workflow from org? |
| --- | --- |
| `budget_cents` | **Yes** — merged via `min()` across scopes |
| `max_calls_per_minute` | **Yes** — merged via `min()` |
| `loop_threshold`, `loop_window_secs` | **Yes** — merged via `min()` |
| `anomaly_mode` | **Yes** — read from any active policy |
| `tool_pattern` / `blocked_tools` / `tools` | **Yes** — union of all ToolBlock policies |
| `policy_type` | No — per-row attribute |
| `scope`, `workflow_id`, `name`, `template_id`, `version` | No — per-row attribute |
| `is_active` | No — a deactivated policy is excluded entirely |

A workflow cannot un-block a tool the org blocks. The merge is
union-only for tool patterns — there is no negative / allow rule.

## Templates

The gateway ships a curated set of policy templates
(`GET /policies/templates` → `enable_template`). Enabling a
template materialises a policy row in your org using the
template's `config` and `name`. Disable reverses it. Templates
are useful for common patterns ("Cap dev workflow at 100c/min",
"Block all write tools") without hand-authoring JSON.
